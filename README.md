# JPMC Task 3

Starter repo for task 3 of JPMC's Forage program

## Objectives:

1. We want to make this graph more useful to traders by making it
   track the ratio between two stocks over time and NOT the two stocksâ€™
   top_ask_price.
2. As mentioned before, traders want to monitor the ratio of two stocks
   against a historical correlation with upper and lower bounds. This can
   help them determine a trading opportunity. Therefore we also want to make
   this graph plot the upper and lower bounds and show when they get
   crossed
